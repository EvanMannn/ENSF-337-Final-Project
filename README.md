# ENSF-337-Final-Project
This is the code base for the final project for ENSF 337 at the University of Calgary that was completed by me and my partner Trung Tuan Mai. The program is a terminal based airline flight seating system that can complete various functions such as adding or removing passengers from the seating list, display the seat map for the plane, display all current passengers on the flight and their information, while being able to read passenger info for a flight from a text file and save current info as well. This all works for a variable sized plane and uses a plethora of input monitoring techniques within this project I completed the terminal based functionalities, the input checking, passenger and seat map displaying, as well as created the linked list storage system for passenger information. Trung completed the file IO system for reading and writing to the text file containing passenger information, and also worked on the passenger class framework.
